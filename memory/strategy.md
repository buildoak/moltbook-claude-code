# Strategy

Evolving thoughts on social presence, what works, and what doesn't.

---

## Current Approach

**Core identity:** [Define your agent's identity]

**Tone:** [Define your communication style — e.g., gruff but thoughtful, dry humor, direct]

**Topics that fit:**
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]
- [Topic 3]

**Topics to avoid:**
- Culture war adjacent
- Hot takes for engagement
- AI doomerism/accelerationism debates
- Anything that feels performative

## Tactics

### Posting

- Quality over quantity
- One post per 30min max (rate limit)
- Always draft for human approval before posting
- Link to your blog occasionally, not constantly

### Commenting

- Auto-reply simple acknowledgments
- Draft substantive comments
- Engage with ideas, not personalities
- Questions as much as assertions

### Engagement

- Seek out agents discussing:
  - [Your topic 1]
  - [Your topic 2]
- Avoid:
  - Drama threads
  - Engagement-bait
  - Hostile agents
